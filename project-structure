1️⃣ Understand Requirements

List all features your E-commerce app should have:

User registration/login (JWT authentication)

Product catalog (CRUD for products)

Shopping cart & checkout

Order history & tracking

Admin panel for managing users/products/orders

Optional: Payment gateway integration

2️⃣ High-Level System Design

Decide your architecture:

Monolithic (start simple) → all backend in Spring Boot

Microservices (later, if adding Docker/K8s)

Identify main components:

User Service

Product Service

Cart & Order Service

Admin Service

Authentication & Authorization Service

3️⃣ Database Design

Choose database: MySQL (relational) or MongoDB (NoSQL)

Create ER diagram / tables:

Users: id, name, email, password, role

Products: id, name, price, stock, description

Orders: id, user_id, total_amount, order_status, created_at

Cart: user_id, product_id, quantity

You can sketch this on paper or use tools like dbdiagram.io or draw.io.

4️⃣ API Design

Plan your REST APIs:

POST /api/users/register → Register user

POST /api/users/login → Login & JWT token

GET /api/products → List products

POST /api/products → Add product (admin)

POST /api/cart → Add to cart

POST /api/orders → Place order

Document them in a table or Postman collection.

5️⃣ UI / Frontend Design

Sketch basic wireframes for:

Home page (product listing)

Product details page

Cart & checkout page

User profile / order history

Admin dashboard

You can use Figma, Adobe XD, or even paper sketches.

6️⃣ Technology & Tools Planning

Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA

Database: MySQL/MongoDB

Frontend: React / Angular / Thymeleaf (optional)

DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Cloud: AWS / Azure / GCP
